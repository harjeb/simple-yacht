* [2025-05-28 10:09:30] - Debug Status Update: Confirmed fix for Flutter localization build error. Localization files regenerated and import paths corrected.
* [2025-05-28 13:25:37] - Code Change: Modified `_generateRoomCode` in `lib/services/matchmaking_service.dart` to generate a 6-digit hexadecimal room code. Ensured `createTestMatch` uses the new room code format.
* [2025-05-28 13:41:00] - TDD: Initiated unit testing for `MatchmakingService` to verify new 6-digit hexadecimal room code generation and its usage in `createTestMatch`. This involves mocking Firebase services and ensuring Firestore interactions are correct.
* [2025-05-28 13:56:00] - TDD: Unit tests for `MatchmakingService` focusing on hexadecimal room codes passed successfully. `MatchmakingService` was refactored for dependency injection to support testability.
* [2025-05-28 14:00:15] - Security Review: Enhanced game room security. Updated `_generateRoomCode` in `lib/services/matchmaking_service.dart` to use `Random.secure()`. Strengthened Firestore rules for `gameRooms` collection to restrict create, read, update, and delete operations to authorized users (host/guest).
* [2025-05-28 14:07:00] - Deployment Started: Game Room Code Update
* [2025-05-28 14:25:00] - Code Change: Implemented `PresenceService` in `lib/services/presence_service.dart` to manage user online status and count. Added `firebase_database` to `pubspec.yaml` and ran `flutter pub get`.
* [2025-05-28 14:36:00] - UI Integration: Integrated `PresenceService` into `MultiplayerLobbyScreen` to display real-time online player count. Initialized `PresenceService` in `main.dart`. Fixed type errors in `PresenceService`.
* [2025-05-29 00:56:00] - Debug Status Update: Started investigation for `MissingPluginException` related to `firebase_database` and `Query#observe`.
* [2025-05-29 00:56:00] - Debug Status Update: Checked `pubspec.yaml`, `presence_service.dart`. `firebase_database` dependency is present.
* [2025-05-29 00:56:00] - Debug Status Update: Inspected `android/app/google-services.json`. Found `firebase_url` is missing, which is critical for Realtime Database.
* [2025-05-29 00:56:00] - Debug Status Update: Checked `android/app/build.gradle.kts` (plugin applied) and `android/build.gradle.kts` (project-level, needs user verification for `google-services` classpath).
* [2025-05-29 01:02:44] - Skipped updating `android/app/google-services.json` as user could not provide a version with `firebase_url`. Added `com.google.gms:google-services:4.4.1` to project-level `android/build.gradle.kts` to address potential `MissingPluginException`.
* [2025-05-29 01:04:32] - Updated `android/app/google-services.json` by manually adding the `firebase_url` provided by the user. Previously, `com.google.gms:google-services:4.4.1` was added to project-level `android/build.gradle.kts`. Instructed user to run `flutter clean` and `flutter pub get`.
* [2025-05-29 01:10:02] - Code Change: Corrected `firebase_url` in `android/app/google-services.json` to `https://yacht-f816d.firebaseio.com` to resolve Firebase URL parsing error.
* [2025-05-29 01:13:10] - Code Change: Updated `com.google.gms.google-services` plugin version to `4.4.1` in [`android/app/build.gradle.kts`](android/app/build.gradle.kts:1) to resolve version conflict. Verified project-level [`android/build.gradle.kts`](android/build.gradle.kts:1) already uses version `4.4.1`.
* [2025-05-29 01:59:45] - Code Change: Unified `com.google.gms.google-services` plugin version to `4.4.1` across all relevant Gradle files ([`android/build.gradle.kts`](android/build.gradle.kts:1), [`android/app/build.gradle.kts`](android/app/build.gradle.kts:1), and [`android/settings.gradle.kts`](android/settings.gradle.kts:1)) to resolve Android build error.
* [2025-05-29 02:13:21] - Code Change: Added `databaseURL` to `FirebaseOptions.web` in [`lib/firebase_options.dart`](lib/firebase_options.dart:58) to resolve Firebase Web runtime error. Value set to `"https://yacht-f816d.firebaseio.com"`.
* [2025-05-29 05:32:00] - Debug Status Update: Resolved "Online Players Count" stuck on "Loading". Corrected Firebase Realtime Database URL and security rules.
* [2025-05-29 05:35:00] - Debug Fix Execution: Verified Firebase Realtime Database URLs and instructed user on rule updates.
* [2025-05-29 12:13:15] - 开始应用名称回退检查。
* [2025-05-29 1:09:24] - 完成应用名称回退检查和修复。
* [2025-05-29 14:38:00] - Debug Status Update: Modified `lib/services/presence_service.dart` to use `FirebaseDatabase.instance`.
* [2025-05-29 14:38:00] - Debug Status Update: Investigating "Undefined class 'FakeFirebaseDatabase'".
* [2025-05-29 14:47:29] - Debug Status Update: Applied fix to PresenceService._goOnline in `lib/services/presence_service.dart`.
* [2025-05-29 15:00:00] - Debug Status Update: Resolved "Undefined class 'FakeFirebaseDatabase'" in [`test/services/presence_service_test.dart`](test/services/presence_service_test.dart:0).
* [2025-05-29 15:08:47] - Current Focus: Implementing refined architecture for `PresenceService`.
* [2025-05-29 15:14:11] - Code Change: Updated `PresenceService.getOnlinePlayersCountStream` and `MultiplayerLobbyScreen`.
* [2025-05-29 15:26:00] - Architect Review: Reviewing and refining architecture for online user counter.
* [2025-05-29 23:33:00] - Code Change: Implemented refined `PresenceService` logic and deprecated `OnlinePresenceService`.
* [2025-05-30 01:06:13] - Architect Review: Reviewed and approved pseudocode for `PresenceService._goOnline` fix.
* [2025-05-30 01:09:00] - Code Change: Modified `_goOnline` in [`lib/services/presence_service.dart`](lib/services/presence_service.dart:100).
* [2025-05-30 08:27:39] - Debug Status Update: Resolved Flutter compilation error in `lib/ui_screens/multiplayer_lobby_screen.dart`.
* [2025-05-30 08:44:29] - Debug Status Update: Investigating Dart Web compilation error 'InvalidType'. Applied safer type casting in `GameRoom.fromMap`.
* [2025-05-30 08:56:00] - Code Change: Updated default ELO to 1000 and default win rate to 50%.
* [2025-06-01 03:13:00] - Debug Status Update: Identified root causes for matchmaking and room joining failures.
* [2025-06-01 04:30:00] - Code Change: Fixed multiplayer bugs: implemented matchmaking logic in `MatchmakingService`, adjusted Firestore rules for `guestId` update, added transaction to `MultiplayerService.joinRoom`, added `roomCode`, `playerNames`, `playerElos` to `GameRoom` model, and unified enum serialization to use `.name`.
* [2025-06-03 01:16:01] - Debug Status Update: Resolved Flutter build errors in [`lib/services/matchmaking_service.dart`](lib/services/matchmaking_service.dart). Corrected missing braces, fixed logic in `getMatchStats`, and ensured non-null return.
